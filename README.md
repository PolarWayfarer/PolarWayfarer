From 2020 I've begun my self-study of web programming technologies using online educational platforms (Mimo, freeCodeCamp, KhanAcademy, javascript.info, w3schools.com, etc.), appropriate resources (such as MDN Web Docs, W3C Accessability Tutorials), technical documentations, articles.

So, I've independently learned (still learning and use these stack): 
+ HTML,
+ CSS & SASS (SCSS),
+ JavaScript & VueJS,
+ Webpack,
+ GIT,
+ BEM methodology.

Have experienced pixel-perfect, desktop-first and mobile-first approaches to build websites.

All my projects are cross-browser and adaptive, some of them - taking accessibility into account.
